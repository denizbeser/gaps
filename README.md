# Falling Through the Gaps: Neural Architectures as Models of Morphological Rule Learning
Code and data for the experiments.

### Notebooks and Data
Experiment notebooks are containedin the notebooks directory.

1. Preprocessing, training, and evaluation code for German, Russian, and English are in `Falling_Through_Gaps_CogSci.ipynb`. The corresponding experiment data and scripts (e.g CELEX) are in the `German`, `Russian`, and `English` directories.

2. The German basesline experiments are in `German_Baseline_McCurdy_et_al__CogSci.ipynb`. The relevant data files are in the `GermanMccurdyComparison` directory.

### Directory Setup
The notebooks are created on Google Colab. Make sure to edit the relevant experiment directories and paths in the notebooks as appropriate, depending on the platform and configuration with which you want to run the notebooks. For example, change `/drive/MyDrive/../German/..` path to `./German/..` for a local configuration.
